# HTML-drawing API

Using the `drawing.drawDOM` function you can draw a DOM element into a [drawing.Group](/api/dataviz/drawing/group), which you can then render with one of the supported backends into SVG, PDF, HTML5 `<canvas>` or VML.

The DOM element must be appended to the document and must be visible (i.e. you cannot draw an element which has `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`, etc.).  For example if you have this HTML in the page:

    <div id="drawMe" class="...">
      ... more HTML code here...
    </div>

You can draw it from JavaScript with the following call:

    drawing.drawDOM("#drawMe").then(function(group){
        // here group is a drawing.Group object

        // you can now draw it to SVG for example:
        var svg = drawing.Surface.create($("#container"), { type: "svg" });
        svg.draw(group);

        // or you can save it as PDF.
        // optionally:
        group.options.set("pdf", {...pdf options...});
        drawing.pdf.saveAs(group, "filename.pdf", proxyUrl);
    });

`drawing.drawDOM` takes a jQuery selector or object, or a plain DOM node, and returns a promise which will deliver a `drawing.Group` object.


### Custom fonts and PDF

If you need PDF output, for optimal layout and Unicode support your document should declare the fonts that it uses using [CSS `font-face` declarations](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face).  Starting with version Q3-2014-SP1, the PDF generator in Kendo UI is able to dig such declarations directly from the CSS and there is no need for you to manually call [pdf.defineFont](/framework/drawing/pdf-output.html#using-custom-fonts).

Here is an example CSS declaration:

    @font-face {
      font-family: "DejaVu Sans";
      src: url("fonts/DejaVu/DejaVuSans.ttf") format("truetype");
    }

Next, to make sure the elements that you are trying to export are using this font, simply specify `font-family: "DejaVu Sans"` in their styles.  For instance, to make all Kendo widgets use this font:

    .k-widget {
      font-family: "DejaVu Sans";
    }

Notes:

- the PDF generator supports only TrueType fonts with Unicode mappings.

- in order for automatic font discovery to work your CSS must reside on the same domain as the web page.

- Kendo UI bundles the DejaVu font family and will fall back to it for a few names like “Times New Roman”, “Arial”, “Courier”, or generics like “serif”, “sans-serif”, “monospace”, if no alternate fonts are specified.  This is so that Unicode works by default.  Note, however, that the layout problem will remain — the PDF output will be slightly different from the browser unless the exact same fonts are used.


### Multi-page PDF output

`drawing.drawDOM` allows you to create a [multi-page PDF](/framework/drawing/pdf-output.html#multiple-pages-output) by specifying manual page breaks (automatic page breaking is not supported).  For this, pass a second options argument which contains `forcePageBreak` — a CSS selector.  Here is an example which draws a grid on a multi-page PDF:

    <div id="grid"></div>

    <script>
      var data = [];
      for (var i = 1; i < 50; ++i) {
        data.push({ title: "Item " + i, id: i });
      }

      $("#grid").kendoGrid({
        dataSource: data,
        rowTemplate: $("#rowTemplate").html()
      });

      kendo.drawing
        .drawDOM("#grid", { forcePageBreak: ".page-break" })
        .then(function(group){
          drawing.pdf.saveAs(group, "multipage.pdf")
        });
    </script>

    <script id="rowTemplate" type="x/kendo-template">
      <!-- to every tenth row we add the "page-break" class -->
      <tr data-uid="#= uid #" class="#= (id%10 == 0 ? 'page-break' : '') #">
        <td>#: title #</td>
        <td>#: id #</td>
      </tr>
    </script>


### Known limitations

- no rendering of shadow DOM

- no CSS box-shadow, text-shadow, gradients

- only `solid` border-style

- the following elements are not rendered: `<iframe>`, `<svg>`.  A `<canvas>` will be rendered as an image, but only if it's “non-tainted” (does not display images from another domain).

- images hosted on different domains might not be rendered, unless permissive [Cross-Origin HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/CORS_enabled_image) are provided by the server.  Similarly, fonts might not be possible to load cross-domain.

- no automatic page breaking is performed

- when the generated document is opened with Acrobat Reader and you try to use the `Save As` option from the file menu an error is thrown. 
`"The document could not be saved. There was a problem reading(23)"`. The solution is to open Acrobat Reader options (Edit → Preferences) and in the "Documents" section uncheck “Save As optimizes for Fast Web View”, which is enabled by default. After this, Save As will work without errors.


## Supported browsers

The HTML renderer has been tested in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Blink-based Opera, Internet Explorer 9 or later.

Internet Explorer <= 8 is not supported.
